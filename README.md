# Razor Page Final Project
This is a repository for the class final project of Programming in C# for Visual Studio .NET Platform I in UCLA Extension.

## Project Description
Taking the Razor Page as template, changed movie to album, and added two more database tables: Song and Artist. Artist has a has-a relationship with Album, and Album has a has-a relationship with Song. Users can search artist by name and the table can be sorted by artist's name, birthday and album in the "Artist" page.

The project was built by following [Microsoft tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-3.1).
